## Overview
A German retailer that mostly sold books sent out a mail offer to its customers on Aug 1, 2014. They recorded the details of relevant purchases that were made in response to the offer, and we used this information to construct machine learning models that predicted the spending in response to the offer. The techniques we used included Linear and Logistic Regressions, PCA, and Cross Validation.
